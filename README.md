# Woohoo!

This is the 3rd Circuit Maker 2 tool coded in Python on my GitHub account! Anyways, you are reading this for the tutorial, right? ... alright lets do it

(Note: You need `Python 3.9` and `pip install cm2py`)

# Tutorial

1) Join a Circuit Maker 2 server.
   ![joined cm2](docs/joined_cm2.png)
2) Now open the tool. (yes i use ms store python)
   ![tool opened](docs/tool_opened.png)
3) Fill everything out in the program.
   ![filled out](docs/filled_out.png)
4) Press Enter, and the window should close, or the program should halt. That's good! The save text is now copied to your clipboard. Click this icon:
   ![registery icon](docs/register_icon.png)
   and a menu should pop up:
   ![registery menu](docs/register_menu.png)
5) Click the words "Plain text", and hold Ctrl and press V. Now, you have the save text in, <span style="color: red;">BUT MAKE SURE TO PRESS ENTER</span>. If the value of "Compressed", "Raw", "Blocks", or "Connections" changes, then you're good.
6) Now, click this icon:
   ![stamper icon](docs/stamp_icon.png)
   Then click somewhere on the map where you want your circle to be. And... ta-da!!

That is **it**! You completed the quest to show a *circle*! You can mess around with the settings. Updates will come soon! ^v^
